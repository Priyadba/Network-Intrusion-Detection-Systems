Network Intrusion detection

Introduction
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) have become an important component in network security infrastructure. Currently, many NIDSs are rule-based systems whose performances highly depend on their rule sets. Unfortunately, due to the huge volume of network traffic, coding the rules by security experts becomes difficult and time-consuming. Since data mining techniques can build intrusion detection models adaptively, data mining-based NIDSs have significant advantages over rule-based NIDSs .
Objective
Analyze the data set, investigate and evaluate the result and predict the overall performance. 
The dataset is networkintrusion.csv .

a)	Select a method for performing the analytic task
b)	Preprocess the data to enhance quality
c)	Carry out descriptive summarization of data and make observations
d)	Identify relevant, irrelevant attributes for building model. 
e)	Perform appropriate data transformations with justifications
f)	Generate new features if needed
g)	Carry out the chosen analytic task. Show results including intermediate results, as needed
h)	Evaluate the solutions
i)	Look for refinement opportunities
